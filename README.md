# 🌍 Modeling Chemical Emissions and River Restoration Potential in Europe

## 🧠 Project Summary
This project explores the intersection of environmental data science and policy by modeling chemical emissions across Europe and assessing their impact on river ecosystems. Using open datasets and geospatial analysis, I identify pollution hotspots and simulate restoration scenarios.

## 🎯 Objective
To showcase my data science skills and environmental modeling expertise in pursuit of a career at CERN — where open science, sustainability, and advanced analytics converge.

## 📊 Key Features
- Analysis of transboundary air pollutants using LRTAP Convention data
- Geospatial mapping of emissions near major European rivers
- Time-series modeling of chemical trends by country and sector
- Restoration potential simulations based on emission reduction scenarios

## 🧪 Data Sources
- [EEA LRTAP Convention Emissions Dataset](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/5be6cebc-ed2b-4496-be59-93736fc4ad78)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Folium)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- GitLab for version control and CI/CD
- Open environmental datasets

## 🚀 Why CERN?
CERN’s commitment to open science and global collaboration aligns with my values. This project demonstrates:
- Scientific rigor in data modeling
- Environmental awareness and policy relevance
- Technical proficiency in reproducible research

## 📌 Next Steps
- Add interactive dashboard (Streamlit or Dash)
- Integrate water quality datasets
- Publish results in a public notebook
